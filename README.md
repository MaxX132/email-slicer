# email-slicer
## Description
A program created out of pure boredom, slices emails to usernames and domains and stores them inside a .xlsx spreadsheet.

## Usage
### Input:
1. Single email address
2. A path to a file including multiple addresses
3. A format of addresses inside a file should look like this:

`username1@domain1.com`

`username2@domain1.com`

`username3@domain2.com`

### Output:
1. If you have entered a single address it will appear sliced in the console using following format: `Username: {email_username} Domain: {email_domain}`
2. If you have a path to a file it will create a new .xlsx file in the same directory as the script what will be a spreadsheet

## Instalation
1. You need to install library from requirements file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the script

## Bugs and Issues
As I said before this is a project out of pure boredom and probably any bugs **WONT** be fixed!
But feel free to fix them yourself...
